  <figcaption id="img-caption">Why did Tupac wear his bandana like that?
Why did Tupac always wear that bandana on his head? Some say he wore it to cover up his bald head, others believe it was a symbol of his allegiance to the Bloods gang. However, the most likely explanation is that Tupac simply liked how it looked and felt. The bandana was comfortable and kept his hair out of his face while he was performing or recording.
